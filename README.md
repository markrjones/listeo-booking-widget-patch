# Important note. 

As of version 1.8.44 this issue was resolved by the Listeo developers. I will leave the code here in case anybody for some reason must remain on an earlier version of the theme, but the recommendation is the update the theme and you should then NOT install this plugin.

# listeo-booking-widget-patch

This is an amended version of a file with the same name that is supplied as part of the Listeo theme by Purethemes. All of this work is theirs, this contribution is the addition of a few lines of code to prevent the display of booking slots earlier than the current time when a same day booking is being made.

To use this file refer to the Listeo documentation that deals with using custom code, found here https://www.docs.purethemes.net/listeo/knowledge-base/customizing-templates/

Please test thoroughly on your installation, it works for me on my client's server but you should test it before using on your own live system(s).
