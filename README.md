# listeo-booking-widget-patch

This is an amended version of a file with the same name that is supplied as part of the Listeo theme by Purethemes. All of this work is theirs, this contribution is the addition of a few lines of code to prevent the display of booking slots earlier than the current time when a same day booking is being made.

To use this file refer to the Listeo documentation that deals with using custom code, found here https://www.docs.purethemes.net/listeo/knowledge-base/customizing-templates/

Please test thoroughly on your installation, it works for me on my client's server but you should test it before using on your own live system(s).
